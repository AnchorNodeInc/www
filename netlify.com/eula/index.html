In the event of a Dispute, you or we must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and a proposed solution. You must send any Notice of Dispute by mail and email to us at the mailing and email addresses provided in the </span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.nexon.net/hc/en-us&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1693191810957927&amp;usg=AOvVaw0GNmAncW8GqltQPYMqK3R6">Contact Us</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;section. We will send any Notice of Dispute to you by mail to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your email address.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Small Claims Court. You may choose to litigate any Dispute in small claims court (or the equivalent) in the Forum specified in Section IX, if the Dispute meets all the requirements to be heard in small claims court.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Binding Arbitration. If the Dispute is not resolved in small claims court, any other effort to resolve the Dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act or any other applicable law. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator&rsquo;s award.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Exceptions to Arbitration. You and Anchor Node agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration:</span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_y0rqfpyufgk1-0 start"><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Anchor Node&rsquo;s intellectual property rights.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Any claim for injunctive relief.</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Any claim you are authorized to bring to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, permit those authorities to seek relief from us on your behalf.</span></li></ul><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Class Action Waiver. Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor we will seek to have any Dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Arbitration Procedures. Any arbitration will be conducted by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (&ldquo;JAMS&rdquo;) under the applicable Consumer or Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the Dispute is filed. If JAMS is unavailable or unable to conduct an arbitration of the Dispute, an alternative arbitration service provider will be mutually agreed upon by both parties. You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the JAMS rules. In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award relief only to you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Arbitrator&rsquo;s Jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Arbitration Fees. Whoever files the arbitration pays the initial filing fee. If we file, we pay. If you file, you pay unless you get a fee waiver under the applicable arbitration rules. All other fees will be allocated as provided by the rules of the arbitration firm and applicable law. Each party will bear the expense of that party&rsquo;s attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Location of Arbitration. You agree that the arbitration will occur in a reasonable location in South Korea, as agreed to by both parties, or, if necessary, as determined by the arbitrator. Disputes Must Be Filed Within One Year. To the extent permitted by law, any Dispute under this agreement must be filed within one year in small claims court or in an arbitration proceeding. The one-year period begins when the Dispute or Notice of Dispute first could be filed.
